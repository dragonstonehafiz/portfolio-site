    """
    I am an undergraduate at the **Singapore Institute of Technology**, majoring in **Applied Artificial Intelligence**. 
    Previously, I studied **Game Development and Technology** at **Nanyang Polytechnic**, where I gained experience in **game programming and software development**.

    I primarily work with **C++ and Python**, applying them to projects in **game development, machine learning, and automation**. 
    My interests include **AI-driven applications, system automation, and optimization**, and I often build tools to **enhance workflows or experiment with new technologies**.

    Beyond programming, I have an interest in **Japanese media**, particularly **anime drama CDs**, which led me to **transcribing and translating content** as a personal project. This site serves as a collection of my work, documenting both academic and personal projects.

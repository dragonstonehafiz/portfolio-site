# Portfolio Site

This repository contains the source code for my **personal portfolio site**, built using **Streamlit**.  
The site serves as a showcase of my projects, including **AI tools, game development work, and automation scripts**.  

📌 **This portfolio site is hosted on [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)**, allowing for **scalable, containerized deployment**.


## 🚀 Features
- **Project Listings** – Organized into categories (Featured, Projects, Mini Projects, Translations).
- **Dynamic Filtering** – Sidebar allows filtering projects by tags.
- **Interactive Design** – Uses Streamlit for a simple, clean UI.
- **Deployment with Docker & Google Cloud Run** – Containerized for cloud hosting.

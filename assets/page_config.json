Some were especially useful in my day-to-day life, while others were just fun to build or helped me learn something new. I wouldn't say they're perfect, but they're the ones I've been most proud of or ended up using the most myself. I hope a few of them might be interesting or helpful to someone else too.",

Some were made to help with budgeting or translating things I enjoy, others were school projects that I tried to push a bit further on my own. I'm still learning, and many of these are works in progress, but each one taught me something new. I keep this page updated as I build or revisit things.",

I started doing this to improve my Japanese, and over time it became a way to better understand the characters and stories I enjoy. Some of the translations were done completely by hand, while others used tools I built to help with transcription and editing. They're not perfect, but I try to keep them accurate and readable. I'm still learning, and doing these translations has helped a lot.",

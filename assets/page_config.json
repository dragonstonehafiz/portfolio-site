I'm still learning, and many of these are works in progress, but each one taught me something new. I keep this page updated as I build or revisit things.",

I started doing this to improve my Japanese, and over time it became a way to better understand the characters and stories I enjoy. Some of the translations were done completely by hand, while others used tools I built to help with transcription and editing. They're not perfect, but I try to keep them accurate and readable. I'm still learning, and doing these translations has helped a lot.",

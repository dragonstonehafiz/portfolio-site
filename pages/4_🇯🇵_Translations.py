    This section is where I share some **fan translation projects**, mainly focused on **Japanese drama CDs**. These are unofficial translations Iâ€™ve worked on as a way to practice and improve my skills, while also making the content more accessible to others who might be interested.

    For each project, Iâ€™ve added:
    - **Subtitles synced to the original audio** for better readability.
    - **Dialogue translations** that try to keep the original tone and character personality.

    I also use tools like:
    - **AI transcription (OpenAI Whisper)** to assist with difficult-to-hear lines.
    - **A small translation helper app** I built to test different phrasing options.

    These are just personal projects, so theyâ€™re not perfect, but I hope theyâ€™re helpful to anyone who enjoys this kind of content!

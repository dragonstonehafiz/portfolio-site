    title="Budgeting Spreadsheet Automation",

    A Python-based tool that automates the setup of budgeting spreadsheets by inserting formulas and formatting new sheets each year. 
    The program ensures consistent calculations and improves readability with automated conditional formatting.
    
    I have since replaced this with my Spending Dashboard project, which is a more robust solution for tracking my spending.

YouTubeCommentAnalyzer = ProjectObject(

    I started this project because I have a small YouTube channel that I run as a hobby and wanted to find out what people were saying about my videos. 
    I also wanted to take a crack at doing **sentiment analysis** just to see how it worked. 
    Using [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3), I extracted video and comment data from my channel which I then used to perform sentiment analysis. 
    Using the generated sentiment scores, I generated multiple Word Clouds to visualize the most frequently appearing words on negative and positive comments.
    
    In the end, I wasn't able to learn anything I didn't already know from the word clouds, but it was a fun project nevertheless.

    Everything in this project was written in `Python`. 
    Libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `wordcloud`, `spacy`, and `sklearn` were used to help with data manipulation and visualization.

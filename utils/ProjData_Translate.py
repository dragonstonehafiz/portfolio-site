    title='Too Many Losing Heroines!!! Drama CD Vol. 1 "I\'ll Teach You The Secret To Style"',
    description="""
    As a fan of *Too Many Losing Heroines!!!*, I found myself wanting more content after finishing all the available light novels. 
    During my search, I discovered that the limited-edition Blu-rays included exclusive drama CDs featuring original stories.  

    Since my Japanese listening skills werenâ€™t very strong, I initially set out to transcribe the audio as a way to improve. 
    However, as I worked through the dialogues, I realized that no one had made this content available on YouTube. 
    Seeing an opportunity to contribute to the fan community, I decided to take on the challenge of translating and subtitling the drama CD myself.
